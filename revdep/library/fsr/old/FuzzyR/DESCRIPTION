Description: Design and simulate fuzzy logic systems using Type-1 and Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic.
    This toolkit includes with graphical user interface (GUI) and an adaptive neuro-
    fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). This toolkit is a continuation from the previous
    package ('FuzzyToolkitUoN'). Produced by the Intelligent Modelling & Analysis Group (IMA)
    and Lab for UnCertainty In Data and decision making (LUCID), University of Nottingham.
