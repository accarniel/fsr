\description{
Fuzzy topological relationships are given as a family of functions that implements spatial plateau topological relationships.
A fuzzy topological relationship expresses a particular relative position of two spatial plateau objects.
Since the spatial objects are fuzzy, their topological relationships are also fuzzy.
Hence, a fuzzy topological relationship determines the degree to which a relation holds for any two spatial plateau objects by a real value in the interval [0, 1].
The key idea of these relationships is to consider point subsets resulting from the combination of spatial plateau
set operations and spatial plateau metric operations on the spatial plateau objects for computing the resulting degree.
The resulting degree can be also interpreted as a linguistic value.
}
\details{
These functions implement topological relationships of the spatial plateau algebra.
They receive two \code{pgeometry} objects of the type \code{PLATEAUREGION} together with some additional parameters (as detailed below).
The family of fuzzy topological relationships consists of the following functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{spa_overlap} computes the overlapping degree of two plateau region objects.
Since it uses the intersection operation, a t-norm operator can be given by the parameter \code{itype}. Currently, it can assume \code{"min"} (default) or \code{"prod"}.
\item \code{spa_meet} computes the meeting degree of two plateau region objects.
Similarly to \code{spa_overlap}, a t-norm operator can be given by the parameter \code{itype}.
\item \code{spa_disjoint} computes the disjointedness degree of two plateau region objects.
Similarly to \code{spa_overlap} and \code{spa_meet}, a t-norm operator can be given by the parameter \code{itype}.
\item \code{spa_equal} - computes how equal are two plateau region objects.
Since it uses the union operation, a t-conorm operator can be given by the parameter \code{utype}. Currently, it can assume \code{"max"} (default).
\item \code{spa_inside} - computes the containment degree of \code{pgo1} in \code{pgo2}.
Similarly to \code{spa_equal}, a t-conorm operator can be given by the parameter \code{utype}.
\item \code{spa_contains} - it is the same of \code{spa_inside} but changing the order of the operands \code{pgo1} and \code{pgo2}.
}

The parameter \code{ret} determines the returning value of a fuzzy topological relationship. The default value is the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{"degree"} (default) - it indicates that the function will return a value in [0, 1] that represents the degree of truth of a given topological relationships.
}

For the remainder possible values, the functions make use of a set of linguistic values that characterize the different situations of topological relationships.
Each linguistic value has an associated membership function defined in the domain [0, 1].
The \code{fsr} package has a default set of linguistic values. You can use the function \code{spa_set_classification} to change this set of linguistic values.

The remainder possible values for the parameter \code{ret} are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"list"} - it indicates that the function will return a named list containing how much the result of the predicate belongs to each linguistic value (i.e., it employs the membership functions of the linguistic values).
\item \code{"bool"} - it indicates that the function will return a Boolean value indicating whether the degree returned by the topological relationship matches a given linguistic value according to an \emph{evaluation mode}.
The evaluation mode and the linguistic values have to be informed by using the parameters \code{eval_mode} and \code{lval}, respectively.
The possible values for \code{eval_mode} are: \code{"soft_eval"}, \code{"strict_eval"}, \code{"alpha_eval"}, and \code{"soft_alpha_eval"}.
They have different behavior in how computing the Boolean value from the membership function of a linguistic value. See their documentations for more details.
Note that the parameter \code{lval} only accept a character value belonging to the set of linguistic values that characterize the different situations of topological relationships.
