## Overview

Many spatial objects (i.e., geographical objects) in reality may have inexact locations, vague boundaries, and/or blurred interiors, and hence cannot be adequately represented by well-known (crisp) spatial objects (e.g., those objects available in spatial libraries like GEOS and GDAL). Fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic are powerful approaches to deal with spatial fuzziness.

Unfortunately, spatial fuzziness has so far not found its way into *spatial data science projects* due to a lack of complete implementations of software packages that can handle fuzzy spatial objects. Motivated by this lack of support, the _fsr_ package has the following advantages:

- It is an implementation of the [fuzzy spatial data types, operations, and predicates](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7737976), including [heterogeneous fuzzy spatial data types](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9177620), based on the [Spatial Plateau Algebra (SPA)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8491565).
- It offers the [construction of fuzzy spatial objects as spatial plateau objects](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8858878) from real spatial datasets.
- It has families of functions that permit users to conduct exploratory (spatial) data analysis by issuing geometric operations and topological predicates on fuzzy spatial objects.
- It allows the design and creation of [fuzzy spatial inference (FSI) models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8015707) to discover new findings from fuzzy spatial objects.
- It provides evaluation methods to process different types of [spatial inference queries by using FSI models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9882658).
